# Ceitepede clon (Original is classic video game for arcade machine)


Gameplay:

The player's machine gun is represented by a small object at the bottom of the screen.
The player moves the gun around the bottom area of the screen with arrows (or other keys)
and shoots at a centipede advancing from the top of the screen down through a field of
mushrooms. Mushrooms are placed randomly. 

Shooting any section of the centipede creates a mushroom and destroys that section.
Shooting one of the middle segments splits the centipede into two pieces at that
point. Each piece then continues independently on its way down the board, with the
first section of the rear piece becoming a new head. If the head is shot, the section behind it 
becomes the next head. The centipede starts at the top of the screen, traveling either left or right. 
When it hits a mushroom or the edge of the screen, it drops one level and switches direction. 
If the centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, player loses one life. When all
lives is gone game over.

The player can destroy mushrooms by shooting them, but each takes several shots to destroy.
Destroying mushrooms can create bonus that moves to bottom of the screen. Posible
bonuses:
● increasing shooting speed;
● increasing moving speed;
● life

The player is also menaced by other creatures besides the centipedes.
● Ants drop vertically, leaving additional mushrooms in their path; they appear
  when fewer than five mushrooms are in the player movement area, though
  the number required increases with level of difficulty.

  
Game modes:

Game can be running in two modes: level and endless. There are differences between that modes.
● Level. In this mode only one centipede apears per game. When all the centipede's segments are 
  destroyed, level is completed. 
● Endless. When all the centipede's segments are destroyed, a new centipede forms at the top
  of the screen. Every time a centipede is eliminated, however, the next one is one
  segment shorter and is accompanied by one additional, fast-moving "head" centipede. Finally there
  will be two fast moving heads. This mode can't be finished with players victory. Game continues
  untill player loses all his lives.

  
Difficulty:

There are three difficulty levels: easy, normal and hard. They differ in centipede's length and speed,
enemies spawn cooldown, start amount of mushrooms and bonus drop chance.
